# Sudoku-In-MIPS-Assembly

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is a simple Sudoku game, with an interactive ruleset that tells the user when the input violates on of the rule. To run this, make sure to have the option to assemble all the files in the directory as the main file uses functions from another file. Otherwise, the main code is in main.asm, which starts the game and when the game is over, it'll print out a game ending message.
